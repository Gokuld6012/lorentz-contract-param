# TZIP

It is a temporary place for TZIPs with assets (contracts).
We store them here because it is easier to maintain them this way.
Specifically, it is easier to test contracts and make sure they are compatible with latest `morley` and to keep contracts synchonized with documentation.
Later we will put them into the [TZIP](https://gitlab.com/tzip/tzip) repo.
